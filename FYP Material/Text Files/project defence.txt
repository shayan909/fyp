U.S. consumers make 26 trips a year to purchase OTC products. 
They only visit doctors, on average, three times a year.
Nearly seven in 10 parents have given their child an OTC medicine late at night to help treat a sudden medical symptom.

These benefits not only accrue to the individual, but to society
as well. The resource savings to the healthcare system through responsible self-medication
allows better allocation of limited healthcare resources and physicians’ time to important
issues beyond the scope of self-care.

OTC products typically contain usage limitations, i.e., if the condition persists
beyond X days, see a physician. Many conditions exist across a spectrum of severity and
symptomatology where it is entirely appropriate to provide products for both self-care and
physician-directed care.



However, according to the
administration’s report, more than 200 thousand people in
China, even 100 thousand in USA, die each year due to
medication errors. More than 42% medication errors are caused
by doctors because experts write the prescription according to
their experiences which are quite limited.

apply technologies to recommendation systems that use the potential knowledge
hiding in medic to decrease medical errors.
