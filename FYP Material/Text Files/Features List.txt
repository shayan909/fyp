The validation of the user login details
occurs here. Then Symptoms are extracted
using String Searching Algorithm where
substring representing the symptoms is
identified in the natural language text
input. When users give directly the
symptom name such as(e.g. “I have a
cough, fever, and nausea”), the system will
easily identify it. But however, the system
should also be able to handle input like,
“When I read, I’m okay at first, but over
time, my eyes seem to get tired, and I start
to see double." In this case, the system
should extract substrings like “eyes tired”
and “see double” (and not substrings like
“read” or “okay”)
